Project/Exercise 21 : Write to a file (https://www.practicepython.org/)
                     Take the code from the How To Decode A Website exercise (if you didnâ€™t do it or just want to play
                     with some different code, use the code from the solution), and instead of printing the results to a
                     screen, write the results to a txt file. In your code, just make up a name for the file you are saving
                     to.

                     Extras:
                     Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be saved.
